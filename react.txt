                        REACT - Front End Technology
                    ------------------------------------



                            Basic command
                        ----------------------
            1. to create react project : npx create-react-app project-name
            2. to run react : npm start
            3. To install Material UI : npm install @mui/material @emotion/react @emotion/styled
            4. To install axios : npm i axios



                            Basic Featues & concepts
                        ------------------------------------

            - It is a collection of JS Libraries : used to design UI
            - creating single page applications
            - Declarative Approach : 
            - Immutable & mutable
            - Pure Functions : functions accept immutable objects and return a new object - its do not cause any side effect : Ex - React component
            - Virtual DOM :
            - JSX (Javascript XML)
                - JSX expressions must have one parent element
                - React fragments : <> </> similar to <div> </div>
                - changes in attribute : always use camel letters
                    - class become className
                    - for become htmlFor
                - to display js expressions in jsx : place js expressions inside a {}
                - to style using Inline Styling in component - css property should be in camel case in an object
                - every jsx element must have closing tag
                - tag without content can be represented as self closing tag : <tag/>
            - Transpling : JSX to (HTML,CSS,JAVASCRIPT) - babel library
            - create react app using create-react-app command
            - Components : small part of UI, React app is a collection of Components, they are arranhged as a tree structure with parent/start node as 'App' component
                - component is a js/jsx file, with filename & component starts with capital letter, it always returns HTML
                - different ways to create Components
                    - Functional / Stateless Components
                    - Class based / Statefull Components
            - Data sharing in React component : one way binding - parent to child
                - using props : property of Components
                    - it is an object
                    - child can access shared data from its Functions argument via props
            - Style React Components - using CSS
                - Inline Style
                - Extrernal Style Sheet
                - CSS Module : file with extension as .module.css
            - React Events
                - without argument function : events bind using its function name only
                - with argument function : event bind using arrow function
                - with event object as argument : event bind using arrow function with argument as event
            - Conditional Rendering
                - if statements : && operator
                - if-else statements : ?: Ternary operator
            - React State : Built in object of react component
                - store property of component
                - state changes and re-render the component : use setState function
            - React component Life Cycle
                - Mounting phase : putting elements into DOM
                    - constructor()
                    - getDerivedStateFromProps()
                    - render()
                    - componentDidMount()
                - Updating phase : Component Updating
                    - getDerivedStateFromProps()
                    - ShouldComponentUpdate()
                    - render()
                    - getSnapshotBeforeUpdate()
                    - componentDidUpdate()
                - Unmounting phase : removing element from DOM
                    - componentWillMount()
            - React Hooks : for making functional component to use react Featues
                - Import hook, and to use call the hook inside component
                - rules for using hook:
                    - can be used only in function component
                    - it can only called at the top level of component
                    - Hooks are not Conditional
                - different type of hooks:
                    - Predefined Hooks
                        - useState(initial-value) : return state and function for updating state
                        - useEffect Hook : allows you to perform side effects in your component
                            useEffect(<function>, <dependency>)
                                - no dependancy passed : runs on every render
                                - an empty array : runs only on first render
                                - props or state value : runs on the first render and any time any dependency value changes
                    - custom Hooks
            - Different between functional and class based component

                    Functional Component                                Class based component
                -----------------------------                       -----------------------------
                1. JS pure function accept props                    1. A class extended from react componment
                    as argument and return                              render function it return jsx 
                    jsx(react elements)                                 (react element)
                2. No need to render function                       2. Need render function to return jsx
                3. Run code from top to bottom,                     3. Component alive depending on the life 
                   once jsx return it cannot be alive                  cycle phase
                4. Stateless component                              4. Stateful component
                5. Hooks are used                                   5. No need to use hook
                6. Constructor is not used                          6. Use constructor to initialise the state
                7. Life cycle methods like                          7. Can use life cycle methods inside 
                   componentDidMount is not used                       component

            - Rendering List : use map method
            - React Form
                - form are handled by component
                - oreventDefault() - method cancels the event if it is cancelable
                - Types of Components
                    - Controlled component : managed by react component
                    - Uncontrolled component : managed by DOM
            - API Call - in react
                - use Axios library : return promise
                    - create a new instance of axios with a custom config
